    <h2>It’s important to become familiar with eating disorder information and education.

     <h3>Individuals with this disorder have symptoms similar to those of bulimia or the binge eating subtype of anorexia.For instance, they typically eat unusually large amounts of food in relatively short periods of time and feel a lack of control during binges.</h3>
